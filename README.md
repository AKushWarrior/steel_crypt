# Steel Crypt 3.0 (BETA)

A comprehensive library of high-level, cryptographic API's, either manually defined or pulled from PointyCastle.
This library currently supports hashing, symmetric two-way encryption, and key/IV generation. It also has 
a CLI, for conducting basic cryptography operations.

This library is a high-level wrapper over https://github.com/bcgit/pc-dart. It used to contain a fork of PointyCastle
within it, but since the package came under the ownership of the BouncyCastle organization, the additions to the fork 
have been added upstream.

It takes time, effort, and mental power to keep this package updated, useful, and
improving. If you used or are using the package, I'd appreciate it if you could spare a few 
dollars to help me continue development.

## Null Safety

This library has been fully ported to null safety. The version 3.0.0 is identical functionally to 2.3.1+6, except for 
this porting process. There may be some slight variance in the interface, due to parameters becoming required where
they were formerly "optional" named parameters.

## Note: Documentation

These docs have not been fully written yet! Steel Crypt 3.X comes with major changes, and will have a static
website on GitHub Pages for documentation. For now, you can take a look at the API reference for more
information on the beta's classes. Each class has fairly extensive documentation.

## Note: RSA Deprecation

As I looked at the package landscape on pub.dev, it became clear to me that packages have become oversaturated, causing
difficult decisions for independent developers. I fear contributing to this issue. 

Additionally, I haven't studied asymmetric encryption; I don't feel comfortable working with it and don't think this
package is adding much to the ecosystem as far as asymmetric encryption goes.

As of today, I will be deprecating RSA functionality in steel_crypt. It is clear to me that there are better packages
for asymmetric encryption; I highly encourage affected users to check out https://pub.dev/packages/crypton. The dev there
actively works on supporting asymmetric operations, more than I ever could, and has a deeper scope of features than this
package would have ever had.
